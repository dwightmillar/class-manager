This is a revamped version of my first full-stack project right after completion of web development bootcamp. I was inspired to revisit and retouch this app by the frustration that my students' schools' approaches to displaying grades left me in. After nearly 2 years worth of further coding knowledge to draw from, I was able to massively clean up the code. I accomplished this by logically separating code using MVC architecture, using JavaScript closures and callbacks purposefully to manipulate data, abstracting common functions, and more. I took special care to apply best practices from React, Webpack, and Express throughout, including code-splitting and lazy-loading components to increase loading speed on the front end, asynchronous coding on the back end, and exception handling throughout. Though feature-wise there are no significant changes, I consider this a big upgrade from the previous iteration on the basis of code readability and organization.
